Here we have some commands to be executed from command line:

1 - npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/script_name.spec.js" //this command will execute the script_name in headless mode
2 - npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/script_name.spec.js" --browser firefox  //this command will execute the script_name in firefox

On package.json at scripts section we can customize the commands to run those tests by usin npm:
Example:

"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "cypress:smoke-firefox": "npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/api_headlessAuth.spec.js' --browser firefox",
    "cypress:smoke-chrome": "npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/api_headlessAuth.spec.js' --browser chrome"
  },

  For running the script for "cypress:smoke-firefox" we should execute the following on command line:  npm cypress:smoke-firefox

  Combine scripts looks like this on package.json:
  "cypress:smoke-all": "npm run cypress:smoke-firefox && npm run cypress:smoke-chrome"

  To execute tests in parallel (Linux and MAC) scripts looks like this on package.json (for been able to run int on Windows we need to install npm-run-all --> npm i npm-run-all):
  "cypress:smoke-all-parallel": "npm-run-all cypress:smoke-chrome cypress:smoke-firefox"

  - Cypress grep allows us to use filters for test execution and also the ability to retry tests
    -command:
    npx cypress run --env grepTags="@smoke",grepOmitFiltered=true,burn=2
    grepOmitFiltered will omit those test that are not smoke to be shown on the tests results in command line
    burn will retry the tests the number of times given
